#URI Builder

## Summary
This tool provides a form in which a URI can be split into its components or built from them.

## Closure Tools
The project has been developed with the [Google Closure Tools](https://developers.google.com/closure/):
* Its OO structure follows the [Closure Library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) guidelines, and also uses its modules.
* It can both be built in debug mode and compiled with the [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/), through respectively the Library's [DepsWriter](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/docs/depswriter) and [ClosureBuilder](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/docs/closurebuilder) python scripts.
* It minifies the CSS with the [Closure Stylesheets](https://code.google.com/p/closure-stylesheets/).
* It generates the index.html's content from its Soy template through the [Closure Templates](https://developers.google.com/closure/templates).
* The javascript code style is checked with the [Closure Linter](https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/)

## Other features
* [Responsive design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)
* [Source maps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/)
